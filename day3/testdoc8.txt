                 Rules for overiding:
Constructors cannot be overridden.
				 
Instance methods can be overridden only if they are inherited by the subclass.

A method declared final cannot be overridden.

A method declared static cannot be overridden but can be re-declared.

If a method cannot be inherited, then it cannot be overridden.

A subclass within the same package as the instance's superclass can override any superclass method that is not declared private or final.

A subclass in a different package can only override the non-final methods declared public or protectedv
